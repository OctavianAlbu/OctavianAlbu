	<h3 class="section">&alefsym; &nbsp Position &nbsp &alefsym;</h3>
<br/><br/>
	<p class="content">The city is located in the center of the county, 100 km north-east of Bucharest, in the South-East of Romania, taking up a total area of 81,3 km2, at the outermost curvature of the Subcarpathian foothills, at the crossroads of the three main Romanian historical provinces: Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia. It is entirely placed on the right bank of Buzău river, which forms its northern limit. The shape of the city is oblong, longer along the river and shorter across. It reaches altitudes of 101 meters in the North-West, near the foothills, going down to 88 meters on the river bank, while the average altitude of 95 meters is the same as the altitude of Dacia square, in the city center.[23] Thus, Buzău is placed in a flat area, with a height difference of just 10 meters along a 4 kilometer line.[23]</p>
<br/><br/>
	<h3 class="section">&alefsym; &nbsp Waterways&nbsp &alefsym;</h3>
<br/><br/>
	<p class="content">Buzău river is the northern limit of the city. This river has created an underground basin that it permanently fuels with water.[24] These underground waters are a main source of drinking water, and their excess overflows to a marshy wetland south of the city, in the neighboring communes Costești, Stâlpu and Țintești, with small but steady springs, that ultimately form the Călmățui river.</p>
<br/><br/>
	<h3 class="section">&alefsym; &nbsp Climate&nbsp &alefsym;</h3>
<br/><br/>
	<p class="content">Annual rainfall is circa 500 mm[26] and in winter the snow cover can be as high as 30 cm.[26] Buzău river has a fluctuating flow. Especially in spring, when it collects melted snow from the mountain area, its level rises. The city was, however, built away from its deep and wide valley, so the river never floods the city. Even at the major floods of 2005, the waters caused no problem in the city proper, but it seriously damaged both bridges across it located in the city,[27] which is also protected by levees, and by the small Cândești dam, north-west of Buzău.[28] The local authorities consider, however, that their strategy of defense against flood does not adequately cover the city's belt road, part of DN2, which follows the river for a short stretch.[29]
	The climate is humid continental, with an average 92 freezing days a year (16 with temperatures below −10 °C), but also with 92 days of hot summer.[26] Local winds include the Crivăț, a cold north-easterly and sometimes easterly wind in winter, and the Austru, a south-westerly wind that brings dry air in summer and leads to warmer days in winter.[30]

	Average, minimum and maximum temperatures, recorded until 2006, are present in the table below. In recent years, the average temperature of July went significantly higher than 22 °C,[31] which pushes Buzău from the Dfb/Dfa limit to inside the Dfa zone in the Köppen climate classification (see also Climate of Romania).</p>
<br/><br/>
	<h3 class="section">&alefsym; &nbsp Flora and Fauna &nbsp &alefsym;</h3>
<br/><br/>
	<p class="content">The flora of Buzău is more diverse in the western forest of Crâng, 189 ha of oak forest, a remainder of the ancient Codrii Vlăsiei. The Crâng park itself takes up 10 hectares of this forest and makes up the main green area of Buzău. It is not designated as a protected area itself, but a few species of plants are protected inside it, such as the fritillaria meleagris and iris brandzae.[33] In the neighboring communes of Țintești and Costești there are other remainders of Codrii Vlăsiei— Frasinu and Spătaru forests, respectively. In the yard of the building at the intersection of Crizantemelor and Tudor Vladimirescu streets, across the street from the park in front of B. P. Hasdeu high school and the Banu church, there is a century-old oak, locally protected as a monument of nature.[34] 6% of the Lunca Buzăului protected area, a Natura 2000 site managed by the Ecological University of Bucharest, lies within city limits, in the north and east.[35]

	Most of the streets in Buzău have trees planted alongside, chestnut on Nicolae Bălcescu boulevard and linden on Unirii boulevard. In their gardens, the locals grow roses, hyacinths, tulips, local peonies, and petunia, as well as grapevines and Virginia creepers for shade. The wild fauna in Buzău is made up of city-dwelling species. The house sparrow and the collared dove are ubiquitous, and the most present small mammals are the wild polecat and the brown rat. Lakes are populated with small fish, such as bitterlings and eel, as well as snails and green lizards.[36]

	During the migration season, a parliament of short-eared owls has made a habit of spending a few days in some tall fir trees located in the yard of the Forestry Inspector's Office in the city center.[37] Experimental crops from the city's Research and Development Station for Olericulture sometimes attract wild boars from the riverside forests.</p>
